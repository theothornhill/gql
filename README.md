# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, and can come in many forms.  You are invited
to open issues, send patches or just start a discussion for what features are
most important.  There are no guidelines for contributions yet, because we are
still in the early stages, so feel free to send some code.

# Development

Development happens over at [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~theo/gql), and you
can open an issue at the [tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~theo/gql), or send an
email to the [mailing lists](https://sr.ht/~theo/gql/lists).  You are also
welcome to open issues at [github](https://github.com/theothornhill/gql) if it
isn't possible to use [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/)


# Test files license

Some test files are taken from the [GraphQL
spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/), and they are listed under
`t/test-files`. These carry the same license as the GraphQl spec, which
currently is MIT.  The same goes for the strings in many of the test cases, they
also are taken from the spec.
