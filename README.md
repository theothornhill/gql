# Test files license
Some test files are taken from the [GraphQL
spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/), and they are listed under
`t/test-files`. These carry the same license as the GraphQl spec, which
currently is MIT.  The same goes for the strings in many of the test cases, they
also are taken from the spec.
